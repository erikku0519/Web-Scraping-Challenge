# Web Scraping Challenge

In this exercise, I guilt an web application that scrapes data from five different websites to gather data related to the Mission to Mars and ultimately displays the information in a single HTML webpage, with following steps along the way:<br>

STEP 1: Initial Scrapping: mission_to_mars.ipynb<br>
* NASA Mars News Site was used to collect the latest New Title and Paragraph Text.(br>
* JPL Featured Space Image Page was used along with Splinter to scrape jpg image file.<br>
* Mars Weather Twitter account was used to scrape latest Mars weather tweets.<br>
* Mars Fact Website was used along with Pandas to gather the facts table about Mars<br>
* USGS Astrogeology site was used to get the images of 4 hemispheres of Mars<br>
<br>


STEP 2: MongoDB and Flask Application<br>
