# Web Scraping Challenge

In this exercise, I guilt an web application that scrapes data from five different websites to gather data related to the Mission to Mars and ultimately displays the information in a single HTML webpage.

STEP 1: Scrapping<br>
https://mars.nasa.gov/news/ website was used to get the latest news on Mars mission using BeautifulSoup, splinter, pandas in a jupyter notebook.<<br>
https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars was used to scrape the featured image of mars in full resolution.
https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en was used to get the latest tweet on the mars weather.<br>
https://space-facts.com/mars/ to gather the facts table about Mars<br>
https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars to get the images of 4 hemispheres of Mars<br>
<br>


STEP 2: MongoDB and Flask Application<br>
